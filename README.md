### 💡 Templates & Examples
There are plenty of examples and templates out there to inspire you, several of which are linked in the table below. 

The first one is the README of a project you are already familiar with if you've gone through Unit 2 of LaunchCode's Software Development program... the full-stack Art Gallery project. Feel free to use it as a general template, but make yours unique and fit your project instead of mine!

## #️⃣ MARKDOWN SYNTAX 

<a name="basics-beyond"></a>
### 📚 The Basics & Beyond
Markdown is *extremely* easy to learn, and well worth the minor effort it takes to use it if you want your README to be easy-to-read and show off your project well.

Headings
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
<!-- etc -->
```

Character Styling
```markdown
Regular
*Italic*
**Bold**
```

Unordered Lists
```markdown
Some things, in no particular order:
- Thing
- Another thing
- Yet another thing
```

Ordered Lists
```markdown
Step-by-step instructions:
1. First, do the thing to get started.
1. Then, do another thing.
1. Finally, do the last thing.
```

Tables
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| :---     |   :--:   |     ---: |
| Left     |  Center  |    Right |
```

... and so much more! The resources below will teach you quite a lot in a short period of time and are great for reference anytime.

## MAKING IT 💥POP💥

<a name="formatting-code"></a>
### 💻 Formatting Code

Whenever you mention a file name like `App.jsx`, a variable reference like `movie.title`, etc., you should use *inline styling* with **single backticks** enclosing the text to highlight.

If you have a *entire block of code*, or perhaps *one or more commands at a prompt*, surround it with **triple backticks** instead. Examples:

```shell
cd project-directory
npm run dev
```

```javascript
function sayHello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello("Bob"); // Hello, Bob!
```

<a name="links"></a>
### 🔗 Links

Links can be added using either markdown syntax or HTML. 

*Example:*

```markdown
[React Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react)
```
or
```markdown
<a href="https://react.dev/reference/react" alt="React Documentation">React Documentation<a>
```
[React Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react)

<a name="images"></a>
### 🖼️ Images

There are 3 ways to add images to your README:

#### METHOD 1
Include an image in your project structure and link it using a relative path. 

*Example:*

  ```markdown
  <!-- Markdown syntax; clean but can't control size -->
  ![LaunchCode logo](images/LaunchCode_ltblue.png)
  ```
  or
  ```markdown
  <!-- HTML - less easy to read but can control size and horizontal alignment -->
  <div align="middle">
      <img src="images/LaunchCode_ltblue.png" alt="LaunchCode logo" width="50%" />
  </div>
  ```
<div align="middle">
  <img src="images/LaunchCode_ltblue.png" alt="LaunchCode logo" width="50%" />
</div>

<br />

#### METHOD 2
Link to an image you are hosting elsewhere on the web. 

*Example:*

```markdown
  <div align="middle">
      <img 
          src="https://github.com/Carolista/carolista.github.io/blob/main/images/cwc-logo.png" 
          alt="CodeWithCarrie logo" 
          width="50%" />
  </div>
  ```
<div align="middle">
      <img 
          src="https://github.com/Carolista/carolista.github.io/blob/main/images/cwc-logo.png" 
          alt="CodeWithCarrie logo" 
          width="50%" />
</div>

<br />

#### METHOD 3
Edit your README on GitHub and drag-and-drop the image. GitHub automatically stores it and provides a URL.

*Example:*

```markdown
  <div align="middle">
      <img 
          width="60" 
          height="60" 
          alt="tiny-rocket" 
          src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30a614e-e024-4ee3-8906-dc96d495432c" />
  </div>
  ```
<div align="middle">
    <img 
        width="60" 
        height="60" 
        alt="tiny-rocket" 
        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30a614e-e024-4ee3-8906-dc96d495432c" />
</div>

> [!WARNING]
> This method is unreliable, and sometimes visitors will see an error message that says the image is private, even though your repo is public. I recommend using one of the other two methods to avoid this issue.

<a name="badges"></a>
### 🔰 Badges
Adding some color and quick-reference info at the top of your README can make it stand out immediately.

There are different styles: ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-flat-darkmagenta)
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-flat--square-rebeccapurple?style=flat-square)
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-plastic-navy?style=plastic)
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-for--the--badge-bada55?style=for-the-badge)
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-social-white?style=social)

You can even add icons: ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F0DB4F?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=323330)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DBFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=20232A)

<a name="emoji"></a>
### 😄 Emoji
You can copy-and-paste emoji into your `.md` document, or if you are editing on GitHub, you can use `:emojicode:` (similar to Slack) with the tab key to insert emoji as you go.

> [!TIP]
> For portfolio project READMEs, use emoji sparingly and tastefully so they complement your content and don't distract from it.

<a name="collapsed-sections"></a>
### ▶️ Collapsed Sections
This one uses a bit of HTML with `<details>` and `<summary>` tags. Test it out below, and learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github#adding-a-collapsed-section).

<details>
  <summary>What's the best way to save your dad jokes? (click me!)</summary>
  ....In a dad-a-base! <em>(insert groan here)</em>
</details>

---

<a name="alerts"></a>
### 🚨 Alerts
There are 5 different styles of special blockquotes you can use known as 'callouts'; I've got examples of some of them in this README. Learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts).

> [!WARNING]
> Don't over-use these or they won't stand out!
